# SQL-Analytics

The primary objective is to leverage the capabilities of SQL analytics as a driving force for fostering business growth. 
This involves the strategic optimization of sales strategies, swift resolution of operational challenges, discerning and catering to loyal customer segments, and crafting targeted marketing initiatives. 
The focus extends to effective inventory management, prompt issue resolution, cultivation of robust customer relationships, and the creation of impactful campaigns. 
Collectively, these efforts contribute to sustained success and continuous growth, thereby facilitating business expansion.

The pertinent tables utilized in this endeavor encompass album, artist, customer, employee, genre, invoice, invoice_line, media_type, playlist, playlist_track, and track. 
These tables serve as the foundational elements upon which SQL analytics is applied, enabling comprehensive insights and informed decision-making to drive the business towards its expansion goals.
